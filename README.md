# Mediators-Beyond-Borders

# This is the repository for the MBBI Interactive Maps Project developed by the DSSD team. This project aims to create a series of interactive maps showcasing MBBI's global impact, allowing stakeholders and members to visualize the organization's work.

## Project Description
The DSSD team collaborated with MBBI to define the purpose and requirements of the interactive maps, highlighting features such as embedded images and videos, initial text, and links to websites/articles. Esri's web based software ArcGIS was chosen for its functionality and accessibility, and the team designed the map interfaces in line with MBBI's marketing and branding styles.

Choose Esri's web based software ArcGIS  due to its ease of use.

### Interface Design:
Handle the design of the interface with feedback from MBBI.
